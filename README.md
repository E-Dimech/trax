# trax

My capstone project during my time as a student at BrainStation.
Trax ia a web application designed and tested for roller coaster enthusiasts. 
With access to an API holding data on every coaster on the planet, users to log the individual coasters they have ridden on their travels around the globe. Integrating a user-friendly experience with features such as speech to text translator, custom-built animation graphics, and an attractive layout and design pattern. My goal is to continue developing this passion project and in the future deploying it to the iOS App Store.
