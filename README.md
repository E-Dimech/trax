# trax

Trax ia a web application designed and tested for roller coaster enthusiasts. 
With access to an API holding data on every coaster on the planet, users can log the individual coasters they have ridden on their travels around the globe. Integrating a user-friendly experience with features such as speech to text translator, custom-built animation graphics, and an attractive layout and design pattern. My goal is to continue developing this passion project and in the future deploying it to the iOS App Store.

Disclaimer::Currently Firefox/Safari do not support the google web API I used in my speech to text translator and will cause the app to crash. Please use Chrome for the best user experience. (I'm working on resolving this issue as you read this)!
